# getsumChecksums v1.0.1

Gathers the MD5 or SHA1 hash of all files in a directory, including subdirectories.

## Expansion

This will be expanded on in the future. Other projects I'm working on will be using this as a base. The code for those expansions will be pushed here under different branches.
